# Q-Ember
Proof without keys. Identity without memory. Trust for agents that outthink persistence - AGI ready
# Q-EMBER Protocol

Quantum Ephemeral Memoryless Binding for Entangled Reasoning (Q-EMBER) defines a cryptographic scaffold for irreversible, stateless identity‚Äîbuilt without wallets, keys, or persistent credentials. Authored by William James Stenner.

## üîë Identity Without Persistence

Q-EMBER introduces a mechanism for presence validation without the need for:

- Wallets or signature chains  
- Private key material  
- Audit trails or recovery vectors

Once proven, identity collapses‚Äîintentionally unrepeatable.

## üß† Built for Synthetic Cognition

This protocol is architected to serve intelligent agents and future AGI systems by enabling:

- Role assumption without static memory  
- Intent signaling through ephemeral proof  
- Stateless authentication across agent boundaries

> Designed for trust‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt need to remember.

## üîê Project Provenance

This repository is timestamped for authorship verification.  
File [`docs/qember_authorship_wjs.txt`](./docs/qember_authorship_wjs.txt) contains the original authorship declaration, SHA256 hashed and anchored via Bitcoin using OpenTimestamps.

> This establishes public provenance without disclosing protected architecture.
