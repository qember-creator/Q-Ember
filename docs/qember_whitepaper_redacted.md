## 1. Abstract

Q-EMBER introduces a new class of identity protocol for environments where memory is adversarial, key persistence is dangerous, and authentication must expire like cognition‚Äînot like credentials. It provides a cryptographically secure, **stateless trust substrate**, built for intelligent agents and synthetic minds.

This paper outlines the principles of collapse-gated proofs, ephemeral identity architecture, and memory-isolated agent negotiation, while redacting implementation-level mechanics pending protection and review.

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional identity systems assume permanence:  
- Keys must be retained  
- Wallets must persist  
- Agents must remember

But in synthetic cognition systems (AGI, multi-agent AI swarms, automated adjudicators), **persistence creates vulnerability**. Every retained credential becomes an attack surface.

Q-EMBER solves for identity when memory cannot be trusted‚Äîand should not be required.

## 3. Solution Overview

Q-EMBER enables:

- üîê **Walletless identity assertion**  
- üìé **Keyless one-time authentication events**  
- üß† **Intent signaling for stateless actors**  
- üîÑ **Role assumption with clean expiry**  
- üö´ **No audit residue, no replay surface**

It achieves this through ephemeral presence proofs that collapse on invocation‚Äîanalogous to quantum state destruction. Once observed (used), they cannot be used again.

## 4. AGI-Relevant Properties

For AGI-class systems, Q-EMBER provides:

- **Stateless authentication**: trust without memory dependencies  
- **Isolation fencing**: cryptographic clean-state between roles or agent sessions  
- **Deniable presence**: verifiable at the edge, untraceable after execution  
- **Multilateral orchestration**: safe inter-agent logic under zero-persistence constraints

This makes Q-EMBER not just identity infrastructure‚Äîbut **an intent layer for minds that self-edit**.

## 5. Protocol Components (Redacted Summary)

The core mechanism employs:

- Entropy collapse functions  
- One-time validation scaffolds  
- Stateless delegation triggers  
- Role-frame compression identifiers

(‚ùó Full architecture, validator code, and entropy mapping logic are withheld.)

## 6. Use Cases

- Memoryless synthetic agents operating across mesh trust zones  
- Stateless financial handshakes without wallets  
- AGI node-to-node cognition bridging  
- Self-destructing smart contract attestation  
- Collapsed role delegation in sovereign AI stacks
